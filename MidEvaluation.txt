Work completed so far:
    Unisteno detects images using MIME detection.
    it performs:
        LSB distribution analysis
        Bitplane histograms (R/G/B)
        Chi-square statistical testing
        Suspiciousness scoring
    Plugins:
        Each analyzer or stego algorithm is a standalone plugin
        New algorithms can be added without touching core logic
    Embedding & Extraction:
        Password-based PRNG-scattered LSB embedding
        CRC32 integrity verification
        Original payload filename preserved on extraction
        Alpha-safe embedding (transparent pixels preserved)

Challenges faced:
    initial LSB embedding logic accidentally overwrote entire pixel bytes instead of just the least significant bit, causing:
        Completely black output images
        Pixel values collapsing to 0 and 1
        Errors like Python integer -2 out of bounds for uint8
    Embedding into RGBA images caused transparent pixels to turn black, visually corrupting PNGs.
    Extraction initially returned a generic .bin file instead of the original payload name.
    Designing a consistent embed–extract data format
    Additional challenges included cross-platform dependency handling, file system inconsistencies
